# Introduction to Django Framework
This project contians the essentials skills to learn how to work with Django Framework.
To be used for the Django Module to:
- Setup and install Django locally 
- Understand the infrastructure of Django Framework 
- How MVC works
- How to deploy your project to Heroku

### Please refer to my in-class notes pdf file for more details

The project general outlines, code pathway, content, and some theories were designed and built based on the following resources:
-	Django Official Documents
-	Heroku Django Deployment Documents  
-	Caleb Smith: Software Developer, Trainer, and Open-Source Contributor
-	John Elder: Web Development and Computer Programming Online Trainer and Founder of Codemy.com
-	Mozilla Developer Network (Learn > Server-side > Django)
-	SQLite Tutorial Dot Net
-	Bootstrap documentations and component
-	DB Browser App for SQLite, Unsplash (for images), W3Schools (Coding), and Wikipedia (free online encyclopedia)

## Important Notes:
-	All the materials in this document were collected, designed, and created by me (the instructor) as an extra help for my students who are learning and studying the essential of “Django Framework” for the first time
-	The general Django project steps were created based on Django online resources with the following changes: 
    -	come up with new different ideas about a fictional college named “ABC College”
    - recreate another content, media, and completely different scenarios and life stories
    -	add some features to make sure that my students can follow the standard and recommended way for any new Python Framework Project like creating a virtual environment as we did with Flask Framework
    - create my notes to deal with mainly PC’s users and Mac’s users
    -	create a full navigation menu to imitate a real website by adding more pages also
    -	apply CSS3 rules for creating a responsive website using Bootstrap framework
    -	apply JavaScript by using jQuery Library of Bootstrap
    -	Prepare our project code to be ready for Heroku deployment 
    -	Implementing our database and running all the migrations remotely in Heroku
    -	More useful things have been added throughout my lectures :slightly_smiling_face:…
- This project with the related pdf in-class docs were designed for people who are coming with basic knowledge in python language and want to start by just learning the essentials of Django framework so they can have the confidence to explore more advanced features with this framework later, plus the deployment to Heroku 
- The course is concise and give the students the core idea for understanding the main infrastructure of Django framework plus the concept URL patterns, Views, Models, Templates of Django which is based on the MVC (Model View Controller)
- The course is up to date and dealing the Django version 3.x.x which is the recent version that was released at the beginning of 2020 as a replacement for Django version 2.x.xx
- This document and the code files are considered to be just a starting point toward using Django Framework with SQLite database. Based on CRUD, it represents only the Read (R) data for the general user using the HTML template while the full implementations of the CRUD operations can be done using administrative interface of the project. Create, Update, and Delete will be implemented using the admin page of Django.
- The pdf file contians the full and official steps to deply/upload your Entire Django Framework to Heroku by teaching you all the required techincal settings and commands that you need to run
